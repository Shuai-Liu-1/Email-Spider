# Email-Spider

This notebook shows how to create or use an email spider, also known as an email scraper or email extractor. It is **important to note** that using email spiders to scrape or extract email addresses from websites or databases without consent is often considered unethical and may be illegal in some jurisdictions. It is always recommended to obtain permission from the website or database owner before collecting email addresses. Additionally, sending unsolicited emails or spam is generally prohibited and can result in penalties and legal consequences.
